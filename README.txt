This project has a login and register page. In addition, I designed a small CMS in which four basic database operations (CRUD) can be performed, considering that each user can only edit or delete their own articles.

for execute this app :
move to: C:\wamp64\www\Project
All file in "Project" folder in "PHP-s30" move to "Project" folder in "C:\wamp64\www\Project" address
open wamp webserver and enter "http://localhost/Project/index.php/" in browser 
open MySQL database on wamp (default username and password -> username: root, password: nothing)
open MySQL database on wamp (current username and password -> username: admin, password: admin)

"cms.sql" is database file for use this project import this file in phpMyAdmin
